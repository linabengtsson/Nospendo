NOSPENDO - project group 37 DH2642 Interaction Programming and the dynamic web 14/12-2020

Nospendo is a shopping simulation that calms the user's shopping desire. We have made the design similar to a real shopping webpage to make the user have a realistic experience. The purpose is that the user should go through the process of shopping on the internet but in the end spend their money on better causes.

The user either log in or creates a new account. Then the user can choose between different categories and search for products. It is possible to mark products as favoriets and put them in the cart. The cart is saved if the user logs out and in again.

We have used ASOS API from Rapidapi: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/asos2.

We have used Firebase for handling accounts, but the contract has expired and therefor it is no longer possible to log in the the webpage.

To use the webpage, one should click on the following link: https://asos-project-group37.web.app/
